# SDN-NFV-Paper-Review

The project contains short 1 page reviews for reseach papers (listed below). These do not contain proper refereces (apologies for that). They were done by me as part of the course "Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)" (2016) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

List of Papers reviewed:
1. OpenFlow: Enabling Innovation in Campus Networks
2. Onix: A Distributed Control Platform for Large-scale Production Networks
3. B4: Experience with a Globally-Deployed Software Defined WAN
4. Ananta: Cloud Scale Load Balancing
5. Header Space Analysis: Static Checking For Networks
6. A NICE Way to Test OpenFlow Applications 
7. Maple: Simplifying SDN Programming Using Algorithmic Policies
8. Composing Software-Defined Networks
9. DevoFlow: Scaling Flow Management for High-Performance Networks
10. The Click Modular Router
11. Making middleboxes someone else's problem: network processing as a cloud service
12. Design and Implementation of a Consolidated Middlebox Architecture
13. OpenNF: Enabling Innovation in Network Function Control
